## React Gallery

This is a personal project that uses React to build a photo gallery. There is a [Demo](http://alickzhang.github.io/react-gallery/).

This project is initialized using create-react-app, so there is no configuration required.

To start the project, follow the commands:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:alickzhang/react-gallery.git
cd react-gallery
npm install
npm start
```
